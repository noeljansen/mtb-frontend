This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## MTB Classifieds Front End Application

This is a work in progress of a Front End Application to be used with the MTB Classifieds project API.

This project uses the latest React.js with Functional Components using Hooks.

I have chosen to use React-Bootstrap for the front-end framework, as React.js does not recommend using JQuery (which regular Bootstrap depends on) in conjuction with React.js.

The routing is handled using the React Router package.

This project is still in the early phases of development. Watch this space!
